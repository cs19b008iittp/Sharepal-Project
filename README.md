***Steps to be followed to set up the react-native project***

1.Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2.Once you have Node.js installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the expo-cli package globally:

  *'npm install -g expo-cli'*
  
3.After expo-cli is installed, you can use it by prefixing the command with npx. For example, to create a new Expo project, you can run:

  *'npx expo init my-project'*
  
  This will create a new project in a directory called my-project and install all the necessary dependencies.
  
4.You can then navigate to the project directory and start the development server using:

  *'npx expo start'*
  
  This will start the development server and open a web browser with the Expo DevTools.
  
5.If you are not able to use web support, you can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

  *'npx expo install react-native-web@~0.18.10 react-dom@18.2.0 @expo/webpack-config@^18.0.1'*
  
6.This will install react-native-web, react-dom, and @expo/webpack-config as dependencies for your project.

  After installing the dependencies, you can try running npx expo start again and selecting the "web" option from the Expo DevTools (by pressing "w" in the terminal).
  
  This should open your project in a web browser.
